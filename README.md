# Text-recognition-in-images
# Overview
This project focuses on implementing text detection using images with the help of EasyOCR, a Python library for optical character recognition. In addition to the text detection functionality, we have developed a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Gradio, which allows users to interact with the text detection system effortlessly.

# Features
# Text detection in images:
    The project utilizes EasyOCR to recognize text present in images, supporting various languages.
# Easy-to-use GUI: 
    The Gradio UI provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to upload images, perform text detection, and view the results.
# Fast and accurate:
    EasyOCR is known for its speed and accuracy, allowing quick and reliable text detection.
# Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)
EasyOCR library (pip install easyocr)
OpenCV library (pip install opencv-python)
Gradio library (pip install gradio)

# Gradio UI Screenshots
Include here the screenshots of the Gradio UI that you want to attach to the README. Describe the functionalities and features available in the UI, such as:

The option to upload an image for text detection.
The ability to choose the language for text recognition.
Displaying the detected text and their confidence levels.
A button to initiate text detection and view the results.

This UI can be very much helpful in tracking field, in-case of regular monitoring of a labelled moving object.
